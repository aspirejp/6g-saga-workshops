        <h3>Workshop Scope</h3>
        <p>
            The 6G-SAGA workshop invites original research contributions and visionary papers on the integration of intelligent aerial and spaceborne systems into 6G networks. 
            The workshop aims to explore the evolution of Satellite–Aerial–Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN) and beyond, focusing on AI-native architectures, joint communication and sensing, and autonomous operations.
